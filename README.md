# About the Challenge

NASA’s oldest daily Earth-viewing satellite – Terra – just turned 25 years old, and with five continuously operating instruments onboard (most taking imagery at the same time), Terra has piled up a LOT of data over the years (over 9,000 days and counting!). This data has the potential to shed light on everything from scientific processes to unique events, all while helping solve problems that affect humans. Your challenge is to use data from any or all of Terra’s five instruments to create an animated product showcasing an Earth science story and emphasizing the impacts to you, your community, and/or the environment.

# Project Summary

We are using the Terra Satellite sensors to show an interactive website that shows fires and their smoke plumes and then the vegetation regrowth rate with the ability to enter a start date and zoom in/out to anywhere in the world. This is intended as education showing that the environment and the earth can recover from fire, but that it takes months and years.
